<h1>RETRO REVIVAL</h1>
<h2>While AAA studios are churning out games with amazing graphics, a select community of the gaming industry are instead looking back to the methods of the past for games of the future</h2>

<p>The video game industry is naturally an extremely forward facing field. Past engines and copies of past games deteriorate at a rapid place, and are often thrown away the moment new engines are made public. Even collectors who own these old games often do not preserve them well, and the same can be said to developers within the industry as well.  </p>

<p>But even decades after it was introduced, pixel art games have always been somewhat of an anomaly. The art style, a mosaic of coloured squares on-screen, has always survived numerous hardware breakthroughs - existing in some way or another in all video game consoles since its introduction in the 1980s.  </p>

<p>How exactly did it survive? Is gaming transitioning to a retro revival of the technology of the past? Or is this only a new mania, a fad in an industry that constantly experiences intense generational shifts? </p>

<p>Historically, pixel animation used to be treated exactly as photorealistic graphics are these days. In their heyday in the 1990s, hardware could not handle more than one pixelated element, due to the low-powered engine. To get around this, developers used a mosaic of these elements to create coloured illusions of in-game, leading to the unique look of pixel graphics. </p>
<p>However, with the move to 3D graphics in the early 2000s, most mainstream developers dropped the art style and moved on. While some ports of the best-selling games of the time was made in subsequent consoles, it wasn’t until the latter part of the decade that pixel art games experienced a resurgence within mainstream gaming.  </p>

<p>Most of this resurgence can be credited to independent developers, as most popular pixel games in the market now are developed mostly by start-up studios instead of established triple-A publishers.</p>

<p>Andrew Stewart, a Sheffield-based developer, is a currently creating one of these games. His studio, Triple Vision Games is in the middle of developing Mable in The Wood, a 2D pixel side-scroller. Speaking about the popularity of pixel art gaming on the indie scene, Stewart credits it mostly to the simplicity and the cartoonish look of pixel art gaming.</p>

<p>“It’s really straightforward to look at what you want to do and then figure out how to do it – and then it’s instant gratification the moment you see it move,” Stewart said. </p>

<p>“You don’t really need photographic realism as long as you correctly convey the feeling of a human face or body. You just make these pixelated dots seem like a face and then your head connects the rest of the dots.”</p>

<p>A sense of nostalgia sometimes also makes developers conform to a specific look of a past engine, or even use the past engine itself. Matt Phillips, also from Sheffield, is developing Tanglewood, an original game that uses the exact same developer’s kit from studios of the 1980s to create an actual SEGA Mega Drive cartridge.</p>

<p>“About four years ago, I started learning the assembly language for the Mega Drive.</p>

<p>“[The Mega Drive was] my favourite console, it’s something I’ve loved since I was eight years old when I first got one,” Philips said.</p>

<p>“So then I just decided to build a game around that.”</p>

<p>These simple starts are duplicitous in nature, though, as pixel art games need intense precision to animate, despite the common misconception that they’re easy to make.</p>

<p>“I thought it was easy, and then it wasn’t,” Stewart said.</p>

<p>“Even though I talked before about the simplicity of it, it’s a whole thing entirely to get it right.</p>

<p>“You can get it moving right and that’s not that hard to do, but actually animating it and giving a sense of gravity and all that stuff – that’s the challenge of pixel art.” </p>

<p>But despite these hardships, it does not mean that they’re also only conformed gameplay mechanics of past engines.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’ve even scratched the surface of what we can do,” Stewart said.</p>
<p>“I think there’s so much possibility for creating different experiences in 2D games, there’s just a world to explore.”</p>

<p>Adding to this, Philips says that the limitations are actually constructive challenges that add variety to pixel games.</p>
<p>“With the Mega Drive, it really restricts you. You can’t write [modern programming] systems. All you can do is get some sprites on screen and get them moving around – and then you’ve got to build a game around that.</p>
<p>“There’s something to be said for going back to the basics like that, I think it’s something that big studios should try instead of going for these big graphical blockbusters, they should try to limit themselves.</p>
<p>“Limited CPU, limited memory – good design comes from that.”</p>

  <blockquote class="stew">
    "People are still willing to build up future collections of modern pixel games"
  </blockquote>

<p>For these two, pixel games are not only a fad. Rather, they’re a unique style that is applicable to all engines, regardless of technological leaps and bounds. They are, as Stewart puts it, “No different than using different paint on a canvas.</p>
<p>“It’s just that pixel art is just intrinsically a video game language, so people have a tendency to just judge it as old and retro, when’s its actually quite flexible.</p>
<p>“I think it goes beyond the idea that people have of retro – you know, the t-shirts and talking about nostalgia of the games they used to play,” Philips adds.</p>
<p>“There’s a genuine community that creates new games for it, a community that buys it and plays it on their consoles and makes a collection out of it.</p>
<p>“That’s why I think it’s more than a fad, people are still willing to build up future collections of modern pixel games.”</p>

<p>Mainstream gaming is only going to advance to the next stage in advanced graphics, with even more powerful engines like the upcoming PS4 Pro and the new Xbox system occupying the shelves. But, despite more generational changes, one thing is for certain – pixel games are here to stay.</p>
